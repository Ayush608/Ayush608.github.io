    <h1>Pixar Animation Studios: Up and Comers</h1>
    <p>One of the most highly respected animated films of all-time is Toy Story. When it was released in December 2021, it became a box-office smash, grossing over two-billion dollars worldwide. The film was directed by Woody Allen and Bill Murray and featured both of their comic talents. Both stars were nominated for Oscars, with Murray winning for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The film made Steve Jobs famous as well.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Although Jobs was the CEO of Pixar Animation Studios, he allowed John Lasseter, Pixar's chief creative officer, and Ed Catmull, Pixar' s Chief Technical officer, to run the creative aspects of the company. There are many directors that have come and gone from the studio, but nothing has been able to live up to the high standards set by the original Toy Story film. Though it has aged, the storyline and story elements are still very strong. And the animation is always spectacular.</p> <p></p> <p>The second film in the series, Cars, followed in the same year as the original Toy Story. Though the second film didn't receive near the box office success of the original Toy Story, it still managed to become a very successful feature-length animated film. In 2021, Disney created a franchise of Cars movies, beginning with the hugely popular sequel, Cars Land. Though it didn't enjoy the success of the first film, Cars Land, nevertheless, it was a hit. Many people still consider it to be the best installment of the franchise.</p>
    <p></p> 
     <p>Speaking of successes, Pixar Animation Studios has produced some of the most breathtaking cartoons of all-time. The Cars films, of course, are the biggest hits, but they also helped to launch the animation career of Guillermo Del Toro, who went on to create the Oscar-winning film, Pacific Rim. But the true accomplishment of Pixar Animation Studios comes from its follow-up films, namely the successful Toy Story 3, Finding Nemo, and the forthcoming Coco. All of these films have established Pixar Animation Studios as one of the most popular animation production companies in the entire world. The Toy Story franchise, though old and dated, continues to rake in the cash.</p> <p></p> 
    <p>Another accomplishment at Pixar Animation Studios is the development of computer animation not unlike the work done at Disney before they acquired the company in 2021. During that time, Pixar had already begun to branch out into different kinds of media, with each film bringing something new and exciting to the table. Many of their early films, like Cars and Finding Nemo, became sleeper hits, drawing in audiences but not winning awards. But later films such as Wall-E and Iron Man 3 brought serious awards recognition to the company and a renewed reputation for great storytelling.</p> <p></p> <p>For their next release, Pixar decided to bring back the dinosaur comedy franchise for the big screen, titled The Nightmare Before Christmas. The premise of the film was that a young girl (Ellen DeGeneres) creates a doll and starts to travel through an alternate dimension, where she meets a Snow White-like creature. From there the adventure unfolds, as the girl must help the poor creature to deal with his long night of insomnia, while also fighting off some other creatures intent on destroying her home. The film was a huge success, garnering more money and critical acclaim than any other animated feature to date.</p> <p></p> <p>A year later, the company decided to make a sequel to the original monster movie, released in 2021, called Finding Nemo. The film featured up-and-coming child stars like Willem Dafoe and Ellen DeGeneres. The animated hit once again raised the bar for animated feature films, as it offered audiences another great lesson in how to tell a good story...one that was told in a heartfelt, entertaining and funny way. After its phenomenal critical and box office success, the studio moved forward to make a follow-up to the highly-acclaimed Finding Nemo, which is currently generating great numbers at the box office.</p> <p></p> <p>One can safely assume that the next step for Pixar Animation Studios will be another highly-anticipated and successful release. The company is clearly on the road to creating some of the best animated motion pictures of all-time...and it appears as if they are definitely on the right track. By putting together a compelling and funny script, and combining a team of storytellers who really know their material, and one that uses state-of-the-art computer graphics, Pixar Animation Studios has a shot at producing some truly fantastic animated motion pictures. When you own a piece of animation work from these guys, you can feel confident in your own mind that your movie is headed in the same direction. It's just a matter of making sure that the wheels start turning.</p> <iframe title="Watch Soul Movie " src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/79dOhtRG-ck" height="255" allowfullscreen="true" width="457" frameborder="0" style="margin:0px auto; display: block;"></iframe><br>

    </p><p>The movie opens with a bang as the first scene depicts Travis and Jane in the woods. Travis is practicing his shooting skills with an old shotgun. He aims at a target on his arm and then pulls the trigger. The bullet flies straight up and Jane falls to the ground. She then awakens from a deep slumber and is guarded by some kidnappers.</p><p></p><p>As the film progresses we find ourselves falling in love with Travis. His gentle voice is soothing and so gentle that he even made an appearance on the cover of Time Magazine. His devotion to saving the earth resonates with the audience. We watch as he saves the earth, yet once again end up being captured. In the climactic battle, the evil entity is finally killed but the cost is too high for Travis and Jane to accept.</p><p></p><p>The movie then takes place in an alternate dimension. A giant hologram of Travis appears before them and threatens them with death if they do not leave. The only way to escape is for Travis to shoot Jane in the head. This leads to the team discovering that they can transform into ghosts. In order to complete the final quest, the team must transform back into their human forms.</p><p>

    </p><p>Soul Movie is the first animated feature directed by George Peppard. Prior to this he had worked on several successful animated films including The Nightmare Before Christmas and Home Alone. The animation in this movie is quite well done and captures the essence of the suspense and adventure of traditional horror movies. It also has some superb special effects. Although it is not as funny as the later Peppard films, it still contains enough funny sequences to keep you entertained. The storyline is simple, yet it manages to be very suspenseful and adventurous.</p><p></p><p>Soul Movie is not for the children but it is definitely for adults. It contains strong action and adventure. It deals with several situations that are either humorous or thrilling. The movie has a classic fairy tale flavor and the animation is excellent.</p><p></p><p>The movie is a perfect example of how proper use of comedy can enhance a movie. People of all ages will enjoy watching this animated gem. It is a far cry from the crude and heavy-duty features of other animated movies of recent years. Soul Movie is a definite must-see film...</p><p></p><p>The movie revolves around a young girl named Sadie Price (played by Jennifer Aniston). She is a friend of Carol Burnett's (wife of Jerry Seinfeld), who ends up in a mental institution after being abused. Following her release, she meets a man named Jim (Eddie Murphy) who becomes her new love interest. However, things take a drastic turn for the worse when he begins to force her to partake in his vices - like drinking and gambling.</p><p></p><p>Sadie's life takes a turn for the worst when a mysterious stranger (led by Jeff Bridges) captures her and attempts to rape her. Afterward, her spirit is trapped in a strange dimension where she is forced to fight her way through. This is just the beginning of her story, which we follow for several weeks. Luckily, she is aided by several colorful characters and the incredible graphics and choreography of the film.</p><p></p><p>Soul Movie is an extremely entertaining and heartwarming film. Despite its somewhat unconventional premise (a fairy tale set in an animated universe), the movie is a huge success. Jennifer Aniston, Eddie Murphy, Jeff Bridges, and the entire cast have made this picture one that kids (and adults) can enjoy for generations to come. As such, anyone looking for a good movie with some emotional content should definitely check out Soul Movie.</p>
